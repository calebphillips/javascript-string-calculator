* Coffeescript implementation is on the coffeescript branch
* I didn't use map, filter, or reduce in my javascript version because it looks like IE 8 doesn't support them (http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/)
  But coffeescript generates js with those methods, so I need to investigate that further.
